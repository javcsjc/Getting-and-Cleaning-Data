Repository for the Course Project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course - Data Science Specialization - Johns Hopkins University.

Overview:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Project Objectives:

* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Modifications to This Script:

Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you will need to make modifications to the run_analysis.R file to correctly set up the location of the source files in your local machine.

Additional Information:

You can find information about the original data sets, temporary data frames and transformations in the CodeBook.md file.
