Course: Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Author: "Jose Alberto Valdez Crespo"

Repository for the Course Project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course. Part of the Data Science Specialization from the Johns Hopkins University.

Overview:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Project Objectives:

1.- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.- Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.- Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Modifications to This Script:

Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you will need to make modifications to the run_analysis.R file to correctly set up the location of the source files in your local machine.

Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.md file.
